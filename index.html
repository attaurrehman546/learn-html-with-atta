<p>
	HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is like the skeleton of a website — it gives structure to everything you see on the internet! Think of it as the recipe that tells your browser how to arrange text, images, headings, and links on a page. Without HTML, websites would be a jumbled mess of words and pictures.

It’s super easy to learn and is the first step if you want to build your own website or just understand how the web works. Using simple tags like h1 for big titles or p for paragraphs, you tell the browser what each piece of content is.

Plus, HTML keeps evolving, adding cool new features that make websites more interactive and fun. So if you’re curious about creating your own online space, HTML is your best friend to start with!
